# Core optimizations
# ===================

# Limit InnoDB buffer size (biggest memory user)
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 128M 

# Reduce InnoDB log size (low write volume in dev)
innodb_log_file_size = 32M # Default 100M
innodb_log_buffer_size = 8M # Default 16M

# ============================
# Connection and thread limits
# ============================

# Reduce concurrent connections. Default is 151, and each connection reserves buffers even if you never hit 150+ concurrent DB users (which you won't in local dev)
max_connections = 50

# Fewer cached threads to reduce idle memory usage. Default is 8-16.
thread_cache_size = 4

# ================================
# Table and cache settings
# ================================

# Cache open tables for multisite (supports ~15â€“20 subsites). Default is 2000.
table_open_cache = 256

# Reduce MyISAM index cache (not really used in WP). Default is 128M.
key_buffer_size = 8M

# Disable query cache (not helpful for modern workloads).
query_cache_type = 0
query_cache_size = 0

# =======================
# Temp tables and sorting
# =======================

# Lower per-connection sort/read buffers
sort_buffer_size = 1M
read_buffer_size = 512K
read_rnd_buffer_size = 512K

# Disable performance schema to save RAM on slower dev machines
